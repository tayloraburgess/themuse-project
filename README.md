# The Muse Interview Project

A small web app, with the backend written purely in Flaskâ€”the client side is entirely templated views that Flask serves (with currently very minimal styling).

The app interacts with The Muse public API, allowing users to filter Jobs, Companies, Posts & Coaches using a number of categories. This is done via POST requests and page re-renders once the user submits their filters.

Additionally, the app scrapes The Muse API to create an exhaustive list of categories that can be filtered, and uses a very simple caching system to avoid constant (and very slow) additional requests for this information.

A test deployment of this app is [here](https://stark-forest-99653.herokuapp.com/).
